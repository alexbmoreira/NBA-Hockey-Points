Hockey Points in the NBA
========================

How would the NBA look if points were given out the same way they were in the NHL?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teams are given 2 points for each win, 1 point for a loss in OT, and 0 points for a regulation loss.

This script will scrape data from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com) and [hockey-reference.com](https://www.hockey-reference.com) and show a combined 61-team seeding for both the NHL and NBA with points distributed as explained above.

How to run:
-----------

`>>> python scrape.py` will write to a `.csv` called `hockey_points.csv`

This file is already sorted based on NHL points tie-breakers.

Why?
----
This was made to practice coding in Python, build a small web scraper, and take data that I could do something fun with, even if it is really simple. Hopefully soon I'll have time to present it as someting nicer than writing to a `.csv` file.
